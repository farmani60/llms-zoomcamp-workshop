Here are some suggested solutions:\\n\\n1. **Move Data**: First, if your data is in a path with spaces (e.g., “C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/…”), move it to a folder without spaces, such as “C:/git/…”.\\n\\n2. **Volume Mapping Options**: Try using one of the following volume mapping options:\\n   - `-v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n   - `-v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n   - `-v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n   - `-v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n   - `--volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n\\n3. **Using `winpty`:** Add `winpty` before the whole command:\\n   ```bash\\n   winpty docker run -it \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\\\\n   -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\\\\n   -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n   postgres:1\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Quotes & Other Adjustments**: \\n   - Use quotes for the volume path:\\n     - `-v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n     - `-v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n     - `-v \"c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data\":/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n\\n5. **Use Volume Name**: If path-based mapping causes issues, consider using a volume name:\\n   - `-v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n\\nIf these suggestions do not solve the issue, double-check the spelling and case of your repository name to ensure it uses only lowercase characters as required by Docker.'"

       "\"If you're unable to connect to Postgres on port 5432 and your password doesn't work, it's likely because the port 5432 is already occupied by another Postgres instance or a local service running on your machine. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\\n\\n1. **Change the Port**: Use a different port for your Docker container. You can map your Postgres service to a different host port, such as 5431, by using `-p 5431:5432` when you run the container. Make sure to update your connection string accordingly to use this new port.\\n\\n2. **Stop Conflicting Services**: Check if there is a local Postgres service running on your machine that is using port 5432. On Windows, you might need to stop this service. You can find and stop this service via the Task Manager or by using the `services.msc` utility.\\n\\n3. **Correct Ports in Connections**: Ensure your application or tool uses the correct mapped port (e.g., 5431 or any other port you've chosen) when trying to connect to Postgres. Update the tools like Jupyter Notebook or pgcli with this new port.\\n\\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, further troubleshooting might be needed to confirm there are no other services using the desired port and that your Docker container is running as expected.\""
